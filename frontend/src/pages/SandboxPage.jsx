1. Practice performing - not just playing. Have mini-concerts at home!

2. Focus on expression, not just notes. Music tells a story.

3. Stay calm and breathe. Nerves are normal, even for pros!

What questions do you have about recital prep? Drop them in the comments and I'll be happy to share tips, stories, and encouragement. Let's make this recital season your child's most confident and joyful yet!`;
